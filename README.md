## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI**

    You will use the Gatsby CLI to develop and generate the static website.

    ```shell
    # install gatsby-cli via npm
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

1.  **Install Dependencies**

    Navigate into your site’s directory and install the necessary dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd modernfolio/
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start Developing**

    Start it up!

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `modernfolio` directory in your code editor of choice. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🎨 Colors!

Various shades of these colors were used in the website. The colors can be changed by altering the CSS variables in `/src/styles/styles.scss`.

| Base Colors  | Hex     |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Cultured     | #F4F5F6 |
| Persian Red  | #C52B2F |
| Spanish Blue | #276EB9 |
| Eerie Black  | #1C1F22 |

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in the project.

    .
    ├── .cache
    ├── content
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/.cache`**: _Automatically generated._ This directory contains all the internal cache created automatically by Gatsby. The files inside this folder are not meant for modification.

2.  **`/content`**: This directory contains all of the markdown files that host the contents of the webpage. This is where you would go to edit the text that is displayed on the webpage.

3.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

4.  **`/public`**: _Automatically generated._ This directory contains all static files (hosted by the server) that Gatsby generated. The output of the build process will be exposed inside this folder.

5.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

6.  **`/static`**: This directory contains the files that will be copied to the `public` folder.

7.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

8.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

9.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

10. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

11. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

12. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

13. **`LICENSE`**: The project is licensed under the MIT license.

14. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

15. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

16. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project. (This file)

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, check out the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to the Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
