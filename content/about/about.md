Hello! My name is Brian Chung, and I’m currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science. I love collaborating with others to discover solutions to difficult problems. I firmly believe that success doesn’t become a reality through only dreams; it takes persistence, dedication, and hard work.

I enjoy keeping myself busy and like a fast-paced environment. I love drinking tea and eating out at restaurants. I visit LA for its food at least once a week.

I look forward to traveling and exploring the world in the future. Check out my social media pages to get to know more about my personal life!
