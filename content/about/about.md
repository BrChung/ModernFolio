Hello! My name is Brian Chung, and I'm currently a senior at California State University, Fullerton, studying Computer Science. I am eagerly seeking Software Engineering opportunities to start my career path.

Success doesn't become a reality through only dreams; it takes persistence, dedication, and hard work. I enjoy creating innovative apps that improve quality of life and productivity. When I am is away from a computer, I enjoy hiking and eating out!
